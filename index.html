      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>Well, my name is Candace and I live and work in Toronto.
      As an <a href="https://www.truity.com/personality-type/INTP" target="_blank">INTP</a>, I love learning, thus, I am in the process of applying for my MBA while I complete a post-graduate certificate in Business Analysis!
      I'm on my last course. On top of that, I am currently learning freelance web development through Codecademy.

      <br><br>I have learned a few programming languages here and there through Codecademy and Code School, and have always found it interesting.
      I'm looking to build my web dev skills to utilize them in a side business building websites.
      This GitHub page is my first project outside of my course, and I will continue to update it as I advance my skills!
      I'm hoping these skills will help me pay for my MBA and pursue my hobbies! Check out some of the <a href="./projects.html">projects</a> I've built through my course!</p>

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p> I'm passionate about <em>design</em>, <em>travelling</em>, and <em>adventures</em>! When I'm not studying for school or working full-time,
        I can be found learning languages, creating designs (interor designs for my place or my parents' renovations), traveling, or on a thrill-seeking adventure.

      <br><br>I have family and friends in Europe, so I enjoy building my language skills in French and Dutch, and travelling to visit them as often as I can!
      I have travelled to Western Europe, London, Australia, and Caribbean, but I always seem to return to Europe!

      <br><br>When I can't be travelling, I love exploring new places in Ontario or doing exhilirating things like skydiving, dirt biking, shooting at the gun range, and hot air ballooning!
      There are still so many things on my bucket list - bungee jumping, white water rafting, and hang-gliding to name a few!</p>
